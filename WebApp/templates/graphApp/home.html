    <h2>1. Visualize</h2>
    <p>Plot a price chart as well as a candlestick chart for any particular stock for a specified period of time using the visualization tool.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>2. Find optimal value for Simple Moving Average</h2>
    <p>A simple moving average (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average. For example, one could add the closing price of a stock for a number of time periods and then divide this total by that same number of periods. Short-term averages respond quickly to changes in the price of the underlying security, while long-term averages are slower to react.
        <p></p>
        The trader should invest when the shorter term SMA is above the longer term SMA whereas they should go short when the shorter term SMA is below the longer term SMA.
        <p></p>
        Use the Optimize SMA tool to find the optimum value of SMA short and SMA long for any company for a specified period of time. The algorithm iterates over 4000 possible combinations of SMA long and short to find the most profitable combination.

    <h2>3. Use Machine Learning based algorithms</h2>
    <p>In machine learning, classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data. Some of the most commonly used classification algorithms are- Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine.
        <p></p>
        Use Logistic Regression or Decision Trees to predict future returns.
